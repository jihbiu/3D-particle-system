Usage of the ThreeJs library to create the project

Main program file is the main.js file, where in the run function we update our program <br />

To install the program: <br />

git clone this-repository <br />
- npm install three (to install the library) <br />
- npm install (to install a local server named vite) <br />
- npm run dev (to start the local server on port 3000)<br />

I'll try to host the website on a vps, <br />
but I don't know how it will go
